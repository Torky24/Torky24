# Hey! Iâ€™m Islam ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi there, Iâ€™m Islam, an AI Engineer based in Bonn, Germany.  
Iâ€™m passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, and **Deep Learning**, and I love building things that actually solve real world problems. That could mean automating boring the boring stuff, making smarter tools, or finding better ways to work with data.

Iâ€™ve worked in data engineering, AI-powered solutions, and full stack development, and Iâ€™m always up for learning, sharing ideas, and collaborating on meaningful projects.

## ðŸ”§ What I Work On  

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve been building recently  

- **Generative AI Applications** â€” end to end AI solutions for industries like automotive, logistics, and manufacturing using RAG, OCR, and LLMs  
- **Document Intelligence** â€” tools that extract data from messy and complex documents, turning months of manual work into minutes  
- **Recommendation Systems** â€” smart engines that suggest products based on customer needs and preferences  
- **Data Engineering** â€” robust ETL pipelines and dashboards for real time insights using Databricks and Azure Data Factory  
- **Ethical AI** â€” adding guardrails to AI models to keep them fair and reduce bias
