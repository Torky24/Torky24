# 👋 Hi, I’m Islam Torky

**Senior AI Engineer — Agentic Systems Specialist**

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a senior AI engineer passionate about building **agentic AI systems**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipelines, and AI-powered tools that actually solve real problems.  
I love working at the intersection of machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and scalable systems — from concept to production.

Currently, I’m designing and deploying **autonomous AI agents** and **dynamic RAG pipelines** for enterprise-grade solutions, while exploring the limits of LLMs and agentic orchestration.

✨ Design **RAG pipelines** with optimized embeddings, chunking, and dynamic context  
✨ Lead **agentic workflows** for multi-step decisions and tool integration  
✨ Develop scalable **FastAPI services** to interface with LLMs and tools  
✨ Ensure production-ready deployment with **CI/CD, observability, and MLOps**
