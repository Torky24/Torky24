## 🔧 What I Do  

Here are some highlights of the things I work on:  

- **Generative AI Applications:** I’ve built end-to-end AI solutions for industries like automotive, logistics, and manufacturing. These solutions leverage technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OCR, and LLMs.  
- **Document Intelligence Systems:** Developed tools that extract data from complex documents, reducing months of manual effort into minutes.  
- **Recommendation Engines:** Designed intelligent systems that can recommend products based on customer descriptions and preferences.  
- **Data Engineering:** Built and maintained robust ETL pipelines and dashboards for real-time insights using tools like Databricks and Azure Data Factory.  
- **Ethical AI:** Implemented AI guardrails to ensure fairness and reduce bias in model outputs.
